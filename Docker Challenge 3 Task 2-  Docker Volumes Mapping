The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, which is supposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon. In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain requirements. Below are more details:

a. On App Server 2 in Stratos DC pull nginx image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).

b. Create a new container with name blog from the image you just pulled.

c. Map the host volume /opt/dba with container volume /tmp. There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; copy that file to /opt/dba. Also please keep the container in running state.

# Solution:
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh steve@stapp02

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
