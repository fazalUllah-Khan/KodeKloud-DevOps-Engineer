The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /opt/apps.git which is cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory present on Storage server 
in Stratos DC. The team want to setup a hook on this repository, please find below more details:


        •	Merge the feature branch into the master branch`, but before pushing your changes complete below point.

        •	Create a post-update hook in this git repository so that whenever any changes are pushed to the master branch, it creates a release tag with name release-2023-06-15, where 2023-06-15 is supposed to be the current date. For example if today is 20th June, 2023 then the release tag must be release-2023-06-20. Make sure you test the hook at least once and create a release tag for today's release.

        •	Finally remember to push your changes.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
