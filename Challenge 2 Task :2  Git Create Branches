Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:


1.	On Storage server in Stratos DC create a new branch xfusioncorp_ecommerce from master branch in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce git repo.

2.	Please do not try to make any changes in the code.
