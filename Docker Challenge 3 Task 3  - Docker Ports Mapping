The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on Application Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:

a. Pull nginx:alpine-perl docker image on Application Server 3.

b. Create a container named ecommerce using the image you pulled.

c. Map host port 8083 to container port 80. Please keep the container in running state.

# Solution:
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh banner@stapp03
The authenticity of host 'stapp03 (172.16.238.12)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Z1c/BhkI5ARPQVFXj5UR4qDxh7vL83BsGkw0EUUsz9Y.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'stapp03,172.16.238.12' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
