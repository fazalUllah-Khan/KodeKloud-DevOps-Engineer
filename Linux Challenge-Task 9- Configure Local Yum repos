The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.


a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named yum_local and make sure to set Repository ID to yum_local. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package wget from this newly created repo.

# Solution:
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh clint@stbkp01
The authenticity of host 'stbkp01 (172.16.238.16)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:TxMGesoYTaqjjBujgL/tWHRhx5HtlN8AWQFpqe7EMAM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'stbkp01,172.16.238.16' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
clint@stbkp01's password: 
[clint@stbkp01 ~]$ sudo su -

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
