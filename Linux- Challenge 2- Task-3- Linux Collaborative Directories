The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups/teams due to security reasons and want their data to be strictly accessed by the sysops group of the team.


Setup a collaborative directory /sysops/data on app server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.

The directory should be group owned by the group sysops and the group should own the files inside the directory. The directory should be read/write/execute to the user and group owners, and others should not have any access.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
